# Warehouse Path Optimization using Reinforcement Learning  

## 📌 Description  
This project leverages **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to optimize path planning in a warehouse environment. The goal is to minimize the travel distance and time for warehouse agents while navigating between pick-up and drop-off points. By training an RL agent, the system learns optimal movement strategies, improving efficiency in logistics and supply chain operations.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Adaptive Path Planning** – Dynamically adjusts based on warehouse layout and obstacles  
- **Reinforcement Learning Optimization** – Utilizes RL techniques to improve navigation efficiency  
- **Scalability** – Can be extended to different warehouse configurations  
- **Customizable Environment** – Easily modify warehouse parameters to test different scenarios  

## 🧠 Reinforcement Learning Approach  
This project uses **Q-learning / Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** (modify based on your implementation) to train an agent to find the most optimal path. The training process includes:  
1. **State Representation:** The warehouse grid is represented as a state space where each position is a state.  
2. **Actions:** The agent can move in four directions: up, down, left, right.  
3. **Rewards:**  
   - **Positive reward** for reaching the destination efficiently.  
   - **Negative reward** for unnecessary steps, collisions, or hitting boundaries.  
4. **Policy Learning:** The agent iteratively learns the best policy using **reward feedback and experience replay**.  

## 🏗 Environment Setup  
The warehouse is modeled as a **grid-based environment**, where:  
- Each cell represents a **warehouse location**  
- Obstacles such as **storage racks** are incorporated into the layout  
- Agents navigate **from a start location to a destination** while avoiding obstacles  
- Reinforcement Learning techniques are applied to optimize the agent’s movement
